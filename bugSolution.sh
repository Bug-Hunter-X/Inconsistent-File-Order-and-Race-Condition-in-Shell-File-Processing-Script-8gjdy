# This improved script uses a null-separated list of files and processes them safely.
# This is more efficient and avoids race conditions

find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d $'\0' file; do
  # ... process each file individually in a safe and consistent manner. ...
  echo "Processing: $file"
  # Add some processing logic here.  For example, if we were looking at images...
  # filetype=$(file -b --mime-type "$file")
  # if [[ "$filetype" == *"image/*"* ]]; then
  #   # Do something with the image file
  # fi
done

# Note: The core solution is not just using 'find' but also ensuring files are processed one at a time in a manner that handles the output of find correctly.
