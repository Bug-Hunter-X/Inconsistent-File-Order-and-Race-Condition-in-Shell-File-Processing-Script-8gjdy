# This script attempts to process files in a directory, but it has a subtle bug.
# It uses a loop that processes files based on their position in the list, which is not guaranteed to be the same across systems.

# This will cause issues where files are processed out of order. 
# It also is vulnerable to race conditions if a file is added or removed from the directory while the script is running.

  # Add some processing logic here.  For example, if we were looking at images...
  # filetype=$(file -b --mime-type "$file")
  # if [[ "$filetype" == *"image/*"* ]]; then
  #   # Do something with the image file
  # fi
